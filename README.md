# Analysis
Summary of analysis
First I looked at the data for NYC.  I looked at how the bikes were used, and some discriptors of who was using the bikes.
Bikes were used mostly by younger people, and men.  Then I looked at the age and gender distribution of NYC and Desmoines, Iowa.  Iowa is a somewhat older population, and has 
slightly more even distribution for gender.  Then I looked to see if there were competitors already in Desmoines.  There is.

Summary of each page in the Tableau story
Page 1:  Shows the age distribution of riders in NYC.  Men outnumber women as users by about 2 to 1.  There were many unknown values in the dataset but I assumed they were uniformly distributed between men and women so the final percentages wouldn't be far off.  The unknowns were therefore removed from the graphic.

Page 2:  Shows the distribution of age (birth year, actually) among NYC riders.  Most riders are were born from 20 to 40 years ago showing that the average rider skews young. 

Page 3:  Shows the demographics of the populations of NYC and Desmoines.  Demoines has a slightly older population (65 and over); 12.4 % in Desmoines vs 11.7 % in NYC. However, the population of males 18 and over is roughly the same between Desmoines and NYC.

Page 4:  Shows the existance of a competitor in Desmoines already sharing bikes.

Clarifying any data that is unclear or complex
While the data show similar demographics in both cities, Desmoines is a small town (roughly 200,000 population) and many not support another bike sharing company.
